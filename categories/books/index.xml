  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Engine-Architecture-Second-Jason-Gregory/dp/1466560010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431611182&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=game+engine+architecture&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XoHf5t-zL._AA160_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the book I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to read for a long time. With close to 1000 pages of pure content, you get a heavily condensed compendium on good, bad and typical practices in game engine design. What&amp;#8217;s great about this book is that even though it reads like something straight out of a university library, all the information is based on the author&amp;#8217;s practical experience. This means that there&amp;#8217;s relatively very little &amp;#8220;dry&amp;#8221; theory in favor of analysis of real life applications and how each component may perform on current gaming hardware. The latter was something I found especially interesting, since there&amp;#8217;s very few articles out there that give you a decent comparison of the XBox or PS4 hardware against a desktop PC. If you never worked in AAA gamedev, you will definitely learn a lot. That said, the book is clearly aimed at people with various programming or industry experience. If you already shipped a title, you may find some parts of the book rather obvious. Nevertheless even having prior knowledge of the covered topics didn&amp;#8217;t prevent me from catching some interesting quirks, making going through the entire thing worthwhile.

  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430727323&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=effective+modern+c%2B%2B&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515MGXnS72L._AA160_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve been on the C++ bandwagon for a while you probably heard about Scott Meyers and his &amp;#8220;Effective...&amp;#8221; book series. While I haven&amp;#8217;t read every single one of them, the ones I did check out always came packed with highly compressed information on how to become a more productive C++ programmer. &amp;#8220;Effective Modern C++&amp;#8221; is, thankfully, no exception.
